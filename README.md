About:
This is a famous game called Connect 4 in which is a two player game in which a player has to connect 4 coins either horizontally, vertically and diagonally. They have to place one coin at a time and alternate places. The first person to have a 4 in a row wins. 
 
Achievement: 
I'm proud of this project because this is the first team project consisting of a group of 4 and one Product Owner. I mostly worked on the css part in which I had very good experience with it. We communicate with each other which leads to an amazing game. I want to be a game developer so I'm very thrilled it came out good and gained experience working with other members.
